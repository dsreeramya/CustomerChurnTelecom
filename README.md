# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction 

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in a telecom company. The project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle to train a binary classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and pickle.

# Problem Statement 

A telecom company wants to reduce customer churn, which is a major problem for the company. The company has a large customer base, and losing customers affects its revenue and reputation. Therefore, the company wants to identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

To address this problem, we will develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. We will use a publicly available dataset that contains information about customer demographics, usage patterns, and account information. The dataset will be used to train a binary classification model that can predict whether a customer will churn or not based on their attributes.

The goal of the project is to develop an accurate model that can predict customer churn and identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn. This will help the company take targeted actions to retain customers and improve its revenue and customer satisfaction.


## Dataset

Describe the dataset used in the project and provide a link to download it.
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about customers who have either stayed with the company or churned. The dataset has 21 columns and 7,043 rows. Each row represents a unique customer, and each column represents a customer attribute, such as demographic information, usage patterns, and customer account information.

The dataset can be downloaded from the following Kaggle link:
